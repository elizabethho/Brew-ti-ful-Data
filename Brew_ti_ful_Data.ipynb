        "## not really possible but do agree that not everyone may understand quality scores\n",
        "My team and I really enjoyed your topic as we all are coffee lovers. One major feedback we have is if possible we think you should somehow include cost as a variable in this analysis. We think either or both the production cost or the retail price would have an impact on the coffee as well. It would be interesting to see how to the quality or the production cost has an impact on the retail price. We think that money would be a better indicator because not everyone would understand quality scores. \n",
        "\n",
        "## possible, but other data has a lot fewer. honestly worth a shot\n",
        "One thing that may be interesting to see is to analyze if the trend shown in the coffee of choice (in this case, the Arabica coffee plant) is reflected in other types of coffee, too. With data across multiple types of coffee plants, it would be interesting to see if any patterns show up like if a certain region seems to produce consistently higher scoring coffee or something similar. Additionally, looking at multiple types of coffee plants may make your analysis more generalized for all types of coffee instead of just the Arabica coffee plant, focusing more on what makes higher scoring coffee rather than just higher scoring Arabica coffee.\n",

        "- I'm a *BIG* coffee drinker (Cav), so I have very high hopes for this project.\n",
        "- Data looks good, and there are a lot of things you can explore with this dataset\n",
        "- The cleaned data has been provided in that Github repo. You may investigate the raw data and cleaned data first to determine if any further cleaning is needed.\n",
        "- In this dataset, the coffee's quality is measured in 11 different dimensions. You may want to take this into consideration when planning for clustering and classification since you are not dealing with a single target.\n",
        "- And for clustering, you may need to spend some time making sense of what you discover. Are there clusters corresponding to \"super strong\", \"chocolatey\", etc.? You will want to see if you can find interesting themes (which may require you to assign your own naming conventions).\n",
        "\n",
        "## maybe allow users to interact with it, subjectivity, coffees with similar attributes\n",
        "Firstly, really good idea for a project overall, interesting and is with a pretty large group of people who would be interested. One question that I have is, is there going to be any way to remove preferences when looking at the quality score, or is the quality score just a value given by some sort of experts in the field? And this might be a bit of a stretch, but one interesting thing y'all might think about doing is some sort of similarity matrix that will let you select a coffee that you already know you enjoy, and find the cluster of coffees with similar attributes. Again though, I think y'all have a really good starting point to branch out from whatever direction y'all go with it!\n",
